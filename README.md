Stern self reminders of how I should do things.

## Debugging

### The scientific method
  - Get a notebook (a real one)
  - Make a hypothesis
  - Write it down!
  - Verify -- record steps and results
  - goto: hypothesis

### Dont trust anything
  - step into standar library functions
  - validate your assumptions

### System Issues
  - strace, /proc
  - tread your code like its someone elses code
